    <h1 id="best1">5. Mario Party: The Top 100 (3DS)</h1>

    <p id="best3">While most of the minigames prove fun on one level or another, there is a looser, "cheaper" feel to some of them. And although players can take advantage of Local or Download Play to engage in some fun multiplayer, there's still a notable lack of online play.</p>
    <h1 id="best1">4. Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash (Wii U)</h1>

    <h1 id="best1" ; color: white">Rating:58/100</h1>
    <p id="best3">In a likely attempt by Nintendo to keep this pretty straightforward tennis experience feeling fresh, they opted to largely revolve the Wii U rendition around the weird, imbalanced concept of oversized players.</p>
    <h1 id="best1">3. Mario Party: Island Tour (3DS)</h1>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0bReA6e3dWc/maxresdefault.jpg" width="700" height="400" />
    <h1 id="best1">Rating:57/100</h1>
    <p id="best3">The selection of minigames is tepid, and the board games are some of the least interesting in the MP franchise. Critics and fans have pointed to their heavy emphasis of random chance rather than skill or tactics. Online play is also disappointedly missing, despite this being a 2013-14 release.</p>
    <h1 id="best1">2. Mario & Sonic At The Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games (Wii U)</h1>

    <p id="best3">
        While one would expect this for a colorful Mario sports game, most of the efforts included are particularly cartoony and repetitive, often leaning on basic motion controls for the crux of the fun.

    <h1 id="best1">1.Mario Party Advance (GBA)</h1>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VEWLDcsh4t8/maxresdefault.jpg" width="700" height="400" />
    <h1 id="best1">Rating:54/100</h1>
    <p id="best3">
        The game very much stresses luck—along with rather shallow gameplay and particularly brief minigames. Mario Party Advance also makes a strange attempt to feel a bit like an RPG with its quest system, but it mostly falls flat.
